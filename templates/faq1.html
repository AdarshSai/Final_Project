			Hospice palliative care is a philosophy of care that aims to relieve suffering and improve the quality of living and dying. It is appropriate for any individual and/or family living with, or at risk of developing, a life-threatening illness. It includes end-of-life care, but is not limited to the time immediately preceding death.

Palliative care is often used interchangeably with hospice palliative care.

Hospice is used to describe a variety of specific services, supports and care settings. Residential hospices create a home-like environment for patients who are at the end of their lives and need constant, sometimes intensive, care.  In contrast, visiting hospices offer care through out-patient facilities or by travelling to a patientâ€™s home.
